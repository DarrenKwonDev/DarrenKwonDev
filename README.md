## About me

I focus on studying and developing technology to farm inefficiencies  
while also paying attention to low-level details to avoid the pitfalls of [leaky abstraction](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/)    

I have few on github because I mostly write code that makes money
