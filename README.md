## About me

I am a programmer with two entrepreneurial experiences.  
I focus on studying and developing technology to make a business impact,  
while also paying attention to low-level details to avoid the pitfalls of [leaky abstraction](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/)    

Recently, I started working as a software developer in the trading industry.
